# Queuing-Behavior-simulation-
This program simulates the queuing behaviour of cars in a single lane of traffic as a function of the arrival rate of the cars and the traffic light sequencing, i.e. the amount of time the lights stay green, amber, and red. The information is read from a file and used as variables in the program.
